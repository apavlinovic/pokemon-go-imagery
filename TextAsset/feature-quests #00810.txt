%PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_1
I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_2
I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_3
You will? That’s great!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_4
First things first, let’s calibrate my instruments to your area.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_5
Could you please complete the following research tasks?\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_0
Great. Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! Now I should be able to detect anything out of the ordinary.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_1
I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_2
Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_3
Please complete the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_0
Incredible! This confirms my initial suspicion. I think we’re seeing evidence of Mew!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_1
A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_2
My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_3
According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_4
Perhaps by studying Pokémon in battle, we’ll learn more!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_5
Please perform the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_3_0
Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! This will help point us in the right direction.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_3_1
Did you know Mew is said to hold the genetic codes of all Pokémon? Mew’s secrets could be a link to understanding the mystery of Pokémon growth and Evolution!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_3_2
Let's study some Pokémon Evolution to learn more about Mew!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_3_3
Please perform these research tasks for me.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_0
Amazing. Just amazing! Isn’t Evolution wondrous? I learn something new every time I see it!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_1
With the data we’ve collected so far, I should be able to pinpoint Mew’s location! It looks like...
quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_2
Yes, it looks like Mew has visited your area recently! Hmm... Interesting. If that's the case, someone should have reported a sighting...
quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_3
Maybe Mew is hiding or disguised as another Pokémon? Let's study some other Pokémon that use these tricks and the best ways to catch them!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_4
Please perform the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_5_0
Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%! With your help, I’ve determined that Mew is invisible!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_5_1
Let's collect some data to build a tool to find it. I have an idea... I’ll need you to study some powerful Pokémon up close to help me out!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_5_2
Could you complete the following research tasks?\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_6_0
Nice! My prototype is functioning well. I’ve upgraded your AR camera with the new ability to see invisible Pokémon!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_6_1
The final step is to lure out Mew. Mew is said only to appear to those who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to meet it...
quest_special_dialogue_mew_6_2
Let’s show Mew what a great Trainer you are and how excited we are to see it!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_6_3
Please carry out the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_0
We found Mew! Awesome! This is an experience to remember forever.
quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_1
Now you can see why I love studying Pokémon so much! The whole world is out there to discover. So go have some fun!
quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_2
My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!

%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1
I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2
We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3
Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4
First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_5
Please complete the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_0
Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1
I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2
Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3
The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4
Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5
Please catch 20 Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, or Ice-type Pokémon!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0
Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_1
However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2
I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3
This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4
Let's do the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0
Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1
I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2
Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3
It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4
The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5
These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6
If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7
Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8
Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!\n{0}\n{1}
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0
That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1
It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2
I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3
Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.
quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4
This weekend will be one to remember!
